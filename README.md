# ThisIsScraper
My local news website (thisisplymouth.co.uk) offers a terrible viewing experience and lots of ads and a nasty javascript asking you to disable adblock over any content if you have such a plugin enabled... This is my attempt to extract the articles in plain text for easier reading :-).

The software provides 2 components written in Python, the scraper which runs on cron periodically to pull any new articles, and the viewer which hosts a small Flask app to display the pulled content.

The original site:

As you can see the original site has alot of advertisements as highlighted in the green bounding boxes and dedicated very little screen space to the actual content... Here is the same article viewed in the ThisIsScraper viewer.
